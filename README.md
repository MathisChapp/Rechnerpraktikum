This is the repository of the group n°6 of the following class :
"Vertiefendes Rechnerpraktikum zur Energietechnik WiSe 2023-2024" at the TU Berlin, given by Mr. Dr.-Ing. Mathias Hofmann.

The main objective is to model a steam generator using the python library TESPy. 
First, it should be fueled by gas (methane).
Then add a heat pump and/or a solar power from a collector field.

Several files can be found :
- "frigo" and "wärme" which are introduction simulations of a heat pump and a refrigerator.
- "Combustion_part"  which is the first draft of the combustion chamber.
- "Dampf_part" which is the first draft of the working fluid part.
- finally, "Dampferzeuger_v1" is the first draft of the total process.

Enjoy, 
Group 6 (Youssef, Mathis and Pierre)
